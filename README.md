Proper decision making for antiVEGF therapy is crucial for the treatment of blinding retinal diseases worldwide. This paper proposes a novel deep learning based OCT image classifier, utilizing a small CNN architecture
named as SimpleNet for classifying OCT images into "urgent referrals", "routine referrals" and "normal" categories. It provides better classification accuracy with 800x fewer parameters, 350x less memory requirement and is 50x faster during testing compared to state-of-the-art deep CNNs.
