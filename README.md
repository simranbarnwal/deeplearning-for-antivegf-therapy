## General info
The codes behind the paper: Barnwal S, Das V, Bora PK. Deep learning based fully automated decision making for intravitreal
anti-VEGF therapy. In International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence
2019. Springer, Cham. (Accepted for Publication)

Proper decision making for antiVEGF therapy is crucial for the treatment of blinding retinal diseases worldwide. This paper proposes a novel deep learning based OCT image classifier, utilizing a small CNN architecture
named as SimpleNet for classifying OCT images into "urgent referrals", "routine referrals" and "normal" categories. It provides better classification accuracy with 800x fewer parameters, 350x less memory requirement and is 50x faster during testing compared to state-of-the-art deep CNNs.
